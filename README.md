# BatteryApp

A simple program that alerts a user when a laptop is 98% charged.
Works on Windows OS

To use it simply double-click on the BatteryApp.exe file and you are done.
  There's no user interface so don't worry if nothing pops up :)
  To check that it is running open the task manager by using the keyboard ctrl + shift + esc
   then look for it("BatteryApp (32 bit)") from the list

To uninstall just delete the BatteryApp folder

If you want it to automatically start every time you power up your pc, do the following:

1. Start the run command by pressing Win + R keys on your keyboard(Win key is the key with the windows logo :) )
2. Type "%ProgramData%" without the quotes then click OK
3. Navigate to the following directory:
          Microsoft > Windows > Start Menu > Programs
4. Copy the BatteryApp folder into the Programs folder and you are done
5. Now the program will automatically start every time you power up your pc.
